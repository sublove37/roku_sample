# Scenegraph master sample

The SceneGraph Master Sample serves as a model for building a certification-compliant channel. It walks developers through each step in developing a basic, high-performance Roku channel that passes certification. It can be used as a reference when building a new Roku channel UI. Because this master sample is certification-compliant, it can also be used as a template for quickly creating and publishing a customized Roku channel.

This master sample contains the individual channels used for the lessons in the [**SceneGraph: Build a Channel** video course](https://developer.roku.com/videos/courses/rsg/overview.md). It includes the following channels:

- GridScreen
- VideoPlayer
- DetailsScreen
