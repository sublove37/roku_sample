# SceneGraph master sample

The SceneGraph Master Sample serves as a model for building a certification-compliant channel. It walks developers through each step in developing a basic, high-performance Roku channel that passes certification. It can be used as a reference when building a new Roku channel UI. Because this master sample is certification-compliant, it can also be used as a template for quickly creating and publishing a customized Roku channel.

## Installation

To run the channels in the master channel, follow these steps:

1. Download and then extract the master channel.

2. In the extracted scenegraph-master-sample-master folder, expand the folder containing the channel you want to run and then compress the contents in the expanded folder to a ZIP file.

3.  Follow the steps in [Loading and Running Your Application](https://developer.roku.com/en-gb/docs/developer-program/getting-started/developer-setup.md#step-1-set-up-your-roku-device-to-enable-developer-settings) to enable developer mode on your device and sideload the ZIP file containing the sample onto it.
