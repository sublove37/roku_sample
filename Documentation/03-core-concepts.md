# Core concepts

This lesson reviews core concepts for Roku channel app development. It explains the basic design principles and key concepts for developing on the Roku platform, outlines the contents and structure of Roku channels, and compares the programming languages used to build Roku channels: SceneGraph and BrightScript. It highlights the different types of SceneGraph components you can use to build the channel UI.

The lesson continues by providing a high-level overview of several key topics such as threading, event handling, and data scoping. It concludes by explaining the importance of factoring graceful degradation in the channel design.

| [SceneGraph core concepts](https://developer.roku.com/docs/developer-program/core-concepts/core-concepts.md) | Read in-depth documentation about many of the SceneGraph topics covered in this video. Roku SceneGraph is the object-oriented, XML framework used to design the UI of Roku channels. These documents explain how to handle critical channel operations such as data scoping, event handling, node and field observers, multi-thread operations, and so on. |
| [BrightScript language reference](https://developer.roku.com/docs/references/brightscript/language/brightscript-language-reference.md) | Learn the fundamentals and syntax of Roku BrightScript, which is the scripting language used to program the behavior of Roku channels. |
