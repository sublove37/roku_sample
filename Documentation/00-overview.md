# Overview

The **SceneGraph Developers: Build a Channel** course teaches novice Roku developers how to develop a channel from the ground up with the Roku SDK. This course walks developers through each step in building a basic, high-performance Roku channel that passes certification. This course is ideal for developers that are new to the Roku platform and want a simple, streamlined path for quickly understanding Roku development.

## Course content

This course starts with introductory material including how to get started developing on the Roku platform, SceneGraph core concepts, and how to create a feed with the metadata for the content in your catalog. It then guides developers on creating the essential screens in a Roku channel UI: the grid screen, video player, details screen, and episode selection screen. It concludes with advanced topics such as monetizing content through video ads and subscriptions, implementing deep linking, and testing a channel for certification-readiness.

## How the video lessons work

Each video lesson is broken down into individual sections that summarize the material being taught, conceptualize the feature being implemented, and demonstrate the completed feature. A step-by-step walkthrough of code is also included in the lessons that build the channel UI and implement video ads, subscriptions, and deep linking. 

The code used in these lessons is included in the master sample channel. For example, the lesson explaining how to build a GridScreen has an associated GridScreen sample channel that you can download, review the code implementation, and then sideload and test on your Roku device. 

## What to do after watching a video lesson

After watching a lesson, finish the tasks in the **Resources** section before moving on to the next lesson. Tasks can include signing up for required Roku accounts, downloading and testing the sample channel accompanying the lesson, and reading developer documentation. 

You can also read the documents in the **Related** documentation to learn more about the specific SceneGraph components, BrightScript code, and tools discussed in the video.
